# 🎬 Movie Watchlist Search

A vanilla JavaScript movie search and watchlist manager powered by the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). No frameworks. No build step. Pure static deployment.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.
